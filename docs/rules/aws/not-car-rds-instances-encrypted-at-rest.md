## Details
Cloudrail will review the RDS instances, clusters and global clusters being created in your environment. If an instance, cluster or global cluster is not set to be encrypted at rest, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation. This rule will only flag a violation for resources that are not yet created.

- **Severity**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium
- **Provider**: Amazon Web Services (AWS)

For the AWS::RDS::Instance, AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster, and AWS::RDS::DBCluster resources, set the StorageEncrypted argument to true.



####  <img src="../_media/emojis/aws.png" alt="aws" width="20"/> Console
Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html> to enable encryption for RDS instances. Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.CreateInstance.html> to enable encryption for RDS clusters. Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-getting-started.html> to enable encryption for RDS global clusters.
