## Remediation
Information on how to fix "Ensure VPC Endpoint for DynamoDB is enabled in all VPCs" using available methods.


####  <img src="../_media/emojis/terraform.png" alt="terraform" width="20"/>  Terraform
Create the aws_vpc_endpoint resource for the corresponding VPC to associate the DynamoDB endpoint. Create the aws_vpc_endpoint_route_table_association resource in order to populate the route table with routes to the DynamoDB service.








#### <img src="../_media/emojis/aws.png" alt="aws" width="20"/> Cloudformation
Create the AWS::EC2::VPCEndpoint resource for the corresponding VPC to associate the DynamoDB endpoint and set the RouteTableIds argument in order to populate the route table with routes to the DynamoDB service.



####  <img src="../_media/emojis/aws.png" alt="aws" width="20"/> Console
Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html> to configure DynamoDB endpoint for the VPC.

## How It Works
Cloudrail will identify all tables and the regions where they exist. For each region, it will check that there is a VPC Endpoint for DynamoDB created and which VPC it's associated to, it will then check all VPCs to identify which ones are not associated to a VPC Endpoint for DynamoDB and will flag it as non-compliant, also if there were no VPC Endpoints in the region but there was a table it will flag all VPCs as non-compliant. It will check that there is at least one resource using an ENI to avoid alerting on unused VPCs.
