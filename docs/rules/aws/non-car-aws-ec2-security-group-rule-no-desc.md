## Remediation
Information on how to fix "Ensure all security groups and rules have a description detailing the rule" using available methods.


####  <img src="../_media/emojis/terraform.png" alt="terraform" width="20"/>  Terraform
For the aws_security_group and aws_security_group_rule resources, set description argument with a proper value. Note, this will force the re-creation of the security group and all resources that depend on it. This is an AWS limitation.








#### <img src="../_media/emojis/aws.png" alt="aws" width="20"/> Cloudformation
For the AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup, AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupEgress, and AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress resources, set Description argument with a proper value.



####  <img src="../_media/emojis/aws.png" alt="aws" width="20"/> Console
Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html> to update the security group or security group rules description field.

## How It Works
Cloudrail will review all security groups within your AWS account. If we find a security group we will check to see if it has a non-default description (for example, ‚ÄúManaged by Terraform‚Äù is considered default). If there‚Äôs a default description, this rule will trigger. In addition, Cloudrail will check that each inbound rule contains a description, if there is no description this rule will trigger. We will also check all outbound rules. If we find an outbound rule that does not have a target CIDR of ‚Äò`0.0.0.0/0`‚Äô (default), we will check to see if there is no description set. If there is no description, this rule will trigger.
