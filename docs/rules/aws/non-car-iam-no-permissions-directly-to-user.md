Remove the permission policy attached to the user. Create a new aws_iam_group resource and attach the permission policy. Use the resource aws_iam_user_group_membership for adding the user to the group.








#### <img src="../_media/emojis/aws.png" alt="aws" width="20"/> Cloudformation
Remove the permission policy attached to the user. Create a new AWS::IAM::Group resource and attach the permission policy. Use the AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition resource for adding the user to the group or modify the AWS::IAM::User Groups argument to add the user to the group.



####  <img src="../_media/emojis/aws.png" alt="aws" width="20"/> Console
Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_create.html> to create an IAM group with the permission policy. Remove the permission policy from the user and follow the guide at to add the IAM user to an IAM group.

## How It Works
Cloudrail will review the IAM settings in your environment, and specifically the users being created. If a user is assigned a permission policy directly, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation.
