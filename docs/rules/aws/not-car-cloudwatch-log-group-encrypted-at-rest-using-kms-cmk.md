## Details
Cloudrail will review the Cloudwatch Log Groups being created in your environment. If a Log Group is not set to encrypt at rest using KMS CMK, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation. This rule will only flag a violation for resources that are not yet created.

- **Severity**: ðŸŸ¢ Low
- **Provider**: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Category**: Logging
- **Rule ID**: not_car_cloudwatch_log_group_encrypted_at_rest_using_kms_cmk
