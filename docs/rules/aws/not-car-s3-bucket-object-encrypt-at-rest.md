## How It Works
Cloudrail will identify all S3 objects in the Terraform plan that are going to be created, are not configured to encrypt data at rest and are created in a non-public bucket. Cloudrail will NOT access the S3 objects you already have in your cloud environment. Cloudrail also will not access the contents of the objects in your Terraform plan.
