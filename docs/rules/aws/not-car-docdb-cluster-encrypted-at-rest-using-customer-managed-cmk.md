## Details
Cloudrail will review the DocDB clusters being created in your environment. If a cluster is not set to encrypt at rest using a customer-managed CMK, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation. This rule will only flag a violation for resources that are not yet created.

- **Severity**: ðŸŸ¢ Low
- **Provider**: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Category**: Database
- **Rule ID**: not_car_docdb_cluster_encrypted_at_rest_using_customer_managed_cmk

## Remediation
Information on how to fix "Ensure DocDB clusters being created are set to be encrypted at rest using customer-managed CMK" using available methods.


####  <img src="../_media/emojis/terraform.png" alt="terraform" width="20"/>  Terraform
For the aws_docdb_cluster resource, set the argument storage_encrypted to true and set the argument kms_key_id to use a customer-managed CMK.








#### <img src="../_media/emojis/aws.png" alt="aws" width="20"/> Cloudformation
For the AWS::DocDB::DBCluster resource, set StorageEncrypted argument to true and set KmsKeyId argument to use a customer-managed CMK.



####  <img src="../_media/emojis/aws.png" alt="aws" width="20"/> Console
Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/encryption-at-rest.html> to enable encryption at rest using a customer-managed CMK.

## How It Works
Cloudrail will identify all DocumentDB clusters in the Terraform plan that are going to be created and are not configured to encrypt data at rest using a customer-managed CMK.
