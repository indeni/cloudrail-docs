## Details
Some organizations require that all resources have at least one tag set. This rule will review the resources that can be tagged, and make sure each one has a tag that is not the Name tag. Resources that are not tagged will be flagged.

## How It Works
Cloudrail will iterate over all resources in the cloud account and Terraform code, and for those that support tags, will check to see if they have any tags set other than the Name tag.
