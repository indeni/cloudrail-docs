# Ensure RDS database is not accessible indirectly via a publicly accessible resource

*Amazon Web Services (AWS) > Database*

## Details
Many organizations would like to protect their databases by multiple layers. For instance, they would want to avoid a situation where a publicly-accessible EC2 instance can directly access a database. The reason behind this is to avoid having ‚Äútwo hops‚Äù into the database from the Internet.

- **Severity**: üü° Medium
- **Provider**: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Category**: Database
- **Rule ID**: indirect_public_access_db_rds

For the aws_db_instance resource, set vpc_security_group_ids argument to reference a Security Group that blocks access from publicly-accessible EC2 instances.

For the AWS::RDS::DBInstance resource, set VPCSecurityGroups argument to reference a Security Group that blocks access from publicly-accessible EC2 instances.

Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.html> to reference a Security Group that blocks access from publicly-accessible EC2 instances.

## How It Works
Cloudrail will review all of the RDS databases configured in your environment. For each database, it will review the security groups in use (where VPC or not), the subnets in use, the public IP configured (on or off) and other aspects. It will then attempt to determine if the database can be accessed from any of the compute resources you have on a public subnet (EC2, ECS, etc.). This determination will take into account the security groups, subnet information, routing and other information, instead of relying solely on the existence of a public IP address. By doing this context-based analysis, Cloudrail ensures that only databases which can truly be accessed by a publicly-accessible compute resource are highlighted.
