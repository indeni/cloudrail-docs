## Details
Elasticsearch Domains should be encrypted whenever possible. Because it is easy to do upon resource creation, Cloudrail will flag a violation if a domain that is set to be created does not have encryption at rest turn on.

## How It Works
Cloudrail will review the Elasticsearch domains being created in your environment. If a domain is not set to encrypt at rest, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation. This rule will only flag a violation for resources that are not yet created.
