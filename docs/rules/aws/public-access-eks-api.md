## How It Works
Cloudrail will review all of the EKS clusters configured in your environment. For each cluster, it will review the whether the API has a public IP and whether it is Internet-accessible on the subnets itâ€™s attached to. This determination will take into account the security groups, subnet information, routing and other information, instead of relying solely on the existence of a public IP address. By doing this context-based analysis, Cloudrail ensures that only EKS clusters whose API can truly be accessed from the Internet are highlighted.
