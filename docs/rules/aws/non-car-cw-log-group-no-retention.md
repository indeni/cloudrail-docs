## How It Works
Cloudrail will identify all cloudwatch log groups in your AWS account and Terraform plan. For each one, we will look to see if there ‚ÄúretentionInDays‚Äù key exists in each of the responses. If this key does not exist, that means there is no retention policy set. This would allow logs to be delivered and stored in this log group forever.
