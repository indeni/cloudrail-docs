For the aws_docdb_cluster_parameter_group resource, in parameter block, ensure parameter "name" is equal to "tls" and "value" is equal to "enabled", or just remove those two parameter to create the DocDB cluster with encryption in transit enabled by default.








#### <img src="../_media/emojis/aws.png" alt="aws" width="20"/> Cloudformation
For the AWS::DocDB::DBClusterParameterGroup resource, ensure Parameters argument contains the 'tls' key with value 'enabled', or just remove them to create the DocDB cluster with encryption in transit enabled by default.



####  <img src="../_media/emojis/aws.png" alt="aws" width="20"/> Console
Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/security.encryption.ssl.html> to enable encryption in transit.

## How It Works
Cloudrail will identify all DocumentDB clusters within your AWS account and Terraform plan that are not configured to perform encryption in transit.
