## How It Works
Cloudrail will review all of the Network interfaces in your environment, and your Security Groups. Cloudrail will create a list of all used Security Groups, based on the Network interfaces in your environment, which are attached to AWS resources. It will then compare this list to the actual Security Groups in the account. For a Security Group which is present, but not used by any attached Network interface, Cloudrail will raise a violation.
