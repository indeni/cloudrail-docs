## Details
The Azure VPN Gateway has different SKUs to choose from, each with different capabilities. The "basic" one is lacking many features and will generally not support anything beyond the smallest load.

- **Severity**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium
- **Provider**: Microsoft Azure
- **Category**: Network
- **Rule ID**: non_car_vpn_gateway_disallow_basic_sku

## How It Works
Cloudrail will review all of the VPN gateways in your Azure environment. If any uses the "basic" SKU, Cloudrail will raise a violation.
