## Details
The interactive serial console does not support IP-based access restrictions such as IP whitelists. If the interactive serial console is enabled on an instance, clients can attempt to connect to that instance from any IP address. This allows unwanted access to that instance if they know the correct SSH key, username, project ID, zone, and instance name. Hence interactive serial console support should be disabled.
