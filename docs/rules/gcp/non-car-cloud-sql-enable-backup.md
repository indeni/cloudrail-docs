For the google_sql_database_instance resources, ensure that backup_configuration option is set to enabled with start_time configured in 24 hr format in UTC.



##### Example Vulnerable Terraform Resource
The following is an example terraform resource vulnerable to *non_car_cloud_sql_enable_backup*.
```hcl
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "backup-config-test" {
  name             = "backup-config-test"
  database_version = "POSTGRES_11"
  region           = "us-central1"

  settings {
    tier = "db-f1-micro"
  }
}


```



##### Example Fixed Terraform Resource
The following is an example terraform resource that has been patched to address the rule.
```hcl
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "backup-config-test" {
  name             = "backup-config-test"
  database_version = "POSTGRES_11"
  region           = "us-central1"

  settings {
    tier = "db-f1-micro"
  }
}

```







####  <img src="../_media/emojis/gcp.png" alt="gcp" width="20"/> Console
Follow the guide at <https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-instance#>  in order to ensure that automated backups are set to enabled and backup time is mentioned.

## How It Works
Cloudrail will review the database instance configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that database connections has backup_configured set to enabled with a specified start time.
