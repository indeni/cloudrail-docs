# Ensure SQL database â€˜cross db ownership chainingâ€™ flag is set to â€˜on'

*Google Cloud Platform (GCP) > Database*

![Cloudrail and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) logos](../images/cloudrail_gcp.png)

## Details
The â€˜cross db ownership chainingâ€™ database flag allows the admins to control cross-database ownership chaining at the database level or to allow cross-database ownership chaining for all databases. Enabling cross db ownership is not recommended unless all of the databases hosted by the instance of SQL Server must participate in cross- database ownership chaining. This recommendation is applicable to SQL Server database instances.

- **Severity**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium
- **Provider**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Category**: Database
- **Rule ID**: non_car_cloud_sql_crossdb_ownership_chaining_on

####  <img src="../_media/emojis/terraform.png" alt="terraform" width="20"/>  Terraform
For the google_sql_database_instance resources, ensure that â€˜cross db ownership chainingâ€™ database flag is set to off for SQL Server databases.



##### Example Vulnerable Terraform Resource
The following is an example terraform resource vulnerable to *non_car_cloud_sql_crossdb_ownership_chaining_on*.
```hcl
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "master" {
  name             = "master-instance"
  database_version = "SQLSERVER_2017_STANDARD"
  region           = "us-central1"

}


```



##### Example Fixed Terraform Resource
The following is an example terraform resource that has been patched to address the rule.
```hcl
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "master" {
  name             = "master-instance"
  database_version = "SQLSERVER_2019_STANDARD"
  region           = "us-central1"
  
  settings {
    database_flags {
        name  = "cross db ownership chaining"
        value = "off"
    }
  }
}


```







####  <img src="../_media/emojis/gcp.png" alt="gcp" width="20"/> Console
Follow the guide at <https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/flags> in order to ensure that â€˜cross db ownership chainingâ€™ database flag is set to off.



##### Example CLI Command
The following is an example CLI command used to address the rule violation.
```sh
DATABASE_INSTANCE_NAME=your_instance_name
gcloud sql instances patch $DATABASE_INSTANCE_NAME --database-flags "cross db ownership chaining=off"

```

## How It Works
Cloudrail will review the database instance configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that SQL Server database instances have â€˜cross db ownership chainingâ€™ database flag set to off.
