## Details
The algorithm used for key signing should be a recommended one and it should be strong. When enabling DNSSEC for a managed zone, or creating a managed zone with DNSSEC, the DNSSEC signing algorithms and the denial-of-existence type can be selected.

For the google_dns_managed_zone resource ensure that dnssec_config block has "state" set to on and default_key_specs block has "algorithm" not set to rsasha1.










####  <img src="../_media/emojis/gcp.png" alt="gcp" width="20"/> Console
Follow the guide at <https://cloud.google.com/dns/dnssec-advanced#advanced_signing_options> in order to ensure rsasha1 is not used for zone-signing and key-signing keys.

## How It Works
Cloudrail will review the google dns zone configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that dnssec state is configured and rsasha1 is not used.
