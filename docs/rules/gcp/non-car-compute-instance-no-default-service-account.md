## Details
The default compute engine service account has the Editor role on the project, which allows read and write access to most Google Cloud Services. To defend against privilege escalations if your VM is compromised and prevent an attacker from gaining access to all of your project, it is recommended to not use the default compute engine service account.

For the google_compute_instance resource ensure the service_account block has attribute email doesnâ€™t use default service account [project_number]- compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com.










####  <img src="../_media/emojis/gcp.png" alt="gcp" width="20"/> Console
Follow the guides at <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts>  and <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances> in order to ensure default service account is not used. VMs created by GKE should be excluded.

## How It Works
Cloudrail will review the compute instances configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that the instances do not use default service account.
