## Details
Contained databases have some unique threats that should be understood and mitigated by SQL Server Database Engine administrators. Most of the threats are related to the USER WITH PASSWORD authentication process, which moves the authentication boundary from the Database Engine level to the database level, hence it is recommended to disable â€˜contained database authenticationâ€™ flag. This recommendation is applicable to SQL Server database instances.Â 

- **Severity**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium
