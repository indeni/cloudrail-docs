Cloudrail is a tool that automates the security review of your infrastructure-as-code.

Cloudrail can run on your workstation as a command line tool, or Visual Studio Code extension, and also runs in the cloud to connect to your cloud provider. By understanding the context of your cloud environment, Cloudrail is able to generate the best possible assessment of the infrastructure code you're currently writing.

For more information about Cloudrail, [check out our about page](about/about.md).
