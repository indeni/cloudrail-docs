# Cloudrail Features
In addition to scanning your infrastructure as code for vulnerabilities, Cloudrail also has the following highlighted features.

## Drift Detection
Detect drifts in your cloud environment from external changes made by developers or other systems. Cloudrail is able to identify when your infrastructure is drifting from its expected state, and notify you accordingly.

## Single Sign On (SSO)
Make user authentication easier through Cloudrail's support of SAML-based single sign on.
